=head1 NAME

Test::WWW::Stub - Block and stub specified URL for LWP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # External http(s) access via LWP is blocked by just declaring 'use Test::WWW::Stub';
    # Note that 'require Test::WWW::Stub' or 'use Test::WWW::Stub ()' doesn't block external access.
    use Test::WWW::Stub;

    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;

    my $stubbed_res = [ 200, [], ['okay'] ];

    {
        my $guard = Test::WWW::Stub->register(q<http://example.com/TEST>, $stubbed_res);

        is $ua->get('http://example.com/TEST')->content, 'okay';
    }
    isnt $ua->get('http://example.com/TEST')->content, 'okay';

    {
        # registering in void context doesn't create guard.
        Test::WWW::Stub->register(q<http://example.com/HOGE/>, $stubbed_res);

        is $ua->get('http://example.com/HOGE')->content, 'okay';
    }
    is $ua->get('http://example.com/HOGE')->content, 'okay';

    {
        # You can also use regexp for uri
        my $guard = Test::WWW::Stub->register(qr<\A\Qhttp://example.com/MATCH/\E>, $stubbed_res);

        is $ua->get('http://example.com/MATCH/hogehoge')->content, 'okay';
    }

    {
        # you can unstub and allow external access temporary
        my $unstub_guard = Test::WWW::Stub->unstub;

        # External access occurs!!
        ok $ua->get('http://example.com');
    }

    my $last_req = Test::WWW::Stub->last_request; # Plack::Request

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::WWW::Stub is a helper module to block external http(s) request and stub some specific requests in your test.

Because this modules uses L<LWP::Protocol::PSGI> internally, you don't have to modify target codes using L<LWP::UserAgent>.

=head1 METHODS

=over 6

=item C<register>

    my $guard = Test::WWW::Stub->register( $uri_or_re, $app_or_res );

Registers a new stub for URI C<$uri_or_re>.
If called in void context, it simply registers the stub.
Otherwise,it returns a new guard which drops the stub on destroyed.

C<$uri_or_re> is either an URI string or a compiled regular expression for URI.
C<$app_or_res> is a PSGI response array ref, or a code ref which returns a PSGI response array ref.
If C<$app_or_res> is a code ref, requests are passed to the code ref following syntax:

    my $req = Plack::Request->new($env);
    $app_or_res->($env, $req);

Once registered, C<$app_or_res> will be return from LWP::UserAgent on requesting certain URI matches C<$uri_or_re>.

=item C<requested_ok>

    Test::WWW::Stub->requested_ok($method, $uri);

Passes when C<$uri> has been requested with C<$method>, otherwise fails and dumps requests handled by Test::WWW::Stub.

This method calls C<Test::More::ok> or C<Test::More::diag> internally.

=item C<requests>

    my @requests = Test::WWW::Stub->requests;

Returns an array of L<Plack::Request> which is handled by Test::WWW::Stub.

=item C<last_request>

    my $last_req = Test::WWW::Stub->last_request;

Returns a Plack::Request object last handled by Test::WWW::Stub.

This method is same as C<[Test::WWW::Stub-E<gt>requests]-E<gt>[-1]>.

=item  C<last_request_for>

    my $last_req = Test::WWW::Stub->last_request_for($method, $uri);

Returns a C<Plack::Request> object last handled by Test::WWW::Stub and matched given HTTP method and URI.

=item C<clear_requests>

    Test::WWW::Stub->clear_requests;

Clears request history of Test::WWW::Stub.

C<[Test::WWW::Stub-E<gt>requests]> becomes empty just after this method called.

=item C<unstub>

    my $unstub_guard = Test::WWW::Stub->unstub;

Unregister stub and enables external access, and returns a guard object which re-enables stub on destroyed.

In constrast to C<register>, this method doesn't work when called in void context.

=item C<import>

    Test::WWW::Stub->import(%options)
    or
    use Test:::WWW::Stub

This C<%options> are equivalent to the options of C<LWP::Protocol::PSGI-E<gt>register(%options)>. For example, the options can be set as follows:

    use Test::WWW::Stub (
        uri => sub {
            my $uri = shift;
            $uri ne 'http://localhost:9200'
        }
    );

=item C<unimport>

    Test::WWW::Stub->unimport
    or
    no Test::WWW::Stub;

Delete the stubbed app and stop stubbing. If you need to stub again, import Test::WWW::Stub.
